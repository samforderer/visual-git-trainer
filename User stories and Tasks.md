 # Initial Setup & Design

1. User Story: Create a responsive design for the app using Figma, so that the interface adapts well to different screen sizes.

   - Tasks: Design the layout with a split-screen interface, define color schemes, and ensure the canvas and Bash window are prominent.

2. User Story: Set up the project repository with proper folder structures, so that the project is organized and manageable.

   - Tasks: Initialize the repository, create folders for assets, scripts, and styles, and configure version control.
   
  3. User Story: Set up a control board, so that, we can manage the workflow on this project.
  
     - Tasks: Design the board in Trello to trace tasks to get done.
     
 # GIT Bash Simulation

4. User Story: Create a simulated GIT Bash window on the left side of the screen, so that I can input GIT commands as I would in a real terminal.

   - Tasks: Develop a custom-styled terminal window using HTML/CSS, implement basic command-line input functionality.

5. User Story: Receive immediate feedback when typing GIT commands, so that I know the system recognizes my input.

   - Tasks: Implement real-time input display, validate entered commands, and show simple prompts or error messages.

 # Canvas Interaction

6. User Story: Implement the right-side canvas to visually represent GIT operations, so that I can see how branches and merges are formed.

   - Tasks: Create a canvas area, implement basic drawing functionality, and map GIT commands to visual actions (e.g., `git branch` creates a new circle).

7. User Story: Implement the visualization so that the main branch and other branches will visually represented on the canvas, so that I can understand the branching structure.

   - Tasks: Draw a main branch line, add circles for commits, and represent branches as diverging lines from the main branch.

 # Core GIT Commands

8. User Story: Create a  visual representation when I create a new branch using `git branch`, so that I can see where the branch diverges from the main branch.

   - Tasks: Implement the `git branch` command, draw a new line diverging from the main branch.

9. User Story: Create a visual representation for merge between branches when I use `git merge`, so that I can understand how branches combine.

   - Tasks: Implement the `git merge` command, visually connect the lines representing the branches.

10. User Story: Set reset the canvas to the initial state, so that I can start a new series of operations without reloading the page.

   - Tasks: Add a reset button that clears all visual elements and resets the Bash window.

 # Additional Features & Improvements

11. User Story: Set a visual indication of where my current HEAD is pointing, so that I can track my position in the branch structure.

    - Tasks: Implement a HEAD pointer that moves along with branch changes and checkout commands.

12. User Story: Having a history log of commands I've entered, so that I can review what operations have been performed.

    - Tasks: Implement a command history panel that logs each command entered.

13. User Story: See animated transitions when branches are created or merged, so that the visual experience is more engaging.

    - Tasks: Add animations to the drawing operations, ensuring smooth transitions between states.
